"""
A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.

Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.

For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:

   0
  / \
 1   0
    / \
   1   0
  / \
 1   1
 """
 
def is_unival(root):
    return unival_helper(root, root.value)
 
def unival_helper(root, value):
    if root is None:
        return True
    if root.value == value:
        return unival_helper(root.left, value) and unival_helper(root.right, value)
    return False

def count_unival_subtrees(root):
    if root is None:
        return 0
    left = count_unival_subtrees(root.left)
    right = count_unival_subtrees(root.right)
    return 1 + left + right if is_unival(root) else left + right

"""
However, this runs in O(n^2) time. For each node of the tree, we're evaluating each node in its subtree again as well. We can improve the runtime by starting at the leaves of the tree, and keeping track of the unival subtree count and value as we percolate back up. This should evaluate each node only once, making it run in O(n) time.
