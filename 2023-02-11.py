"""
Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer in linear time and constant space. In other words, find the lowest positive integer that does not exist in the array. The array can contain duplicates and negative numbers as well.

For example, the input [3, 4, -1, 1] should give 2. The input [1, 2, 0] should give 3.

You can modify the input array in-place.

        lst.append(n)

#The following solution takes O(N) time because it only iterates through both lists once.        
"""
Create a list full of 0â€™s with the size of the max value of the given array. 
Now, whenever we encounter any positive value in the original array, change the index value of the list to 1. 
After that simply iterate through the modified list, the first 0 encountered, (index value + 1) should be the answer.
